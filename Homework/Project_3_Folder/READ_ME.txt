READ_ME




this assignment project_3 Part 1 has two smaller parts, the first is just the excel where we put the comments we made on other teams and in that very excel on the far right column i gave each team a rating 1-10 as requested, it introduced/considers the games playability,readability.... everything mentioned on canvas. 

Additionally, i ran through most of the code i reviewed and commented and had chat gpt help find things like msipellings and immediate faulty logic before running, some of my reviews are just improvments to the game that help ux

Please let me know if you run into any issues on this submission 


very respectfully
